# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create either /etc/ranger/rc.conf
# (system-wide) or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf (per user) and add your custom
# commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Which viewmode should be used?  Possible values are:
#     miller: Use miller columns which show multiple levels of the hierarchy
#     multipane: Midnight-commander like multipane view showing all tabs next
#                to each other
set viewmode miller
#set viewmode multipane

# How many columns are there, and what are their relative widths?
set column_ratios 1,3,4

# Which files should be hidden? (regular expression)
set hidden_filter ^\.|\.(?:pyc|pyo|bak|swp)$|^lost\+found$|^__(py)?cache__$

# Show hidden files? You can toggle this by typing 'zh'
set show_hidden true

# Ask for a confirmation when running the "delete" command?
# Valid values are "always", "never", "multiple" (default)
# With "multiple", ranger will ask only if you delete multiple files at once.
set confirm_on_delete always

# Use non-default path for file preview script?
# ranger ships with scope.sh, a script that calls external programs (see
# README.md for dependencies) to preview images, archives, etc.
#set preview_script ~/.config/ranger/scope.sh

# Use the external preview script or display simple plain text or image previews?
set use_preview_script true

# Automatically count files in the directory, even before entering them?
set automatically_count_files true

# Open all images in this directory when running certain image viewers
# like feh or sxiv?  You can still open selected files by marking them.
set open_all_images true

# Be aware of version control systems and display information.
set vcs_aware false

# State of the four backends git, hg, bzr, svn. The possible states are
# disabled, local (only show local info), enabled (show local and remote
# information).

# Truncate the long commit messages to this length when shown in the statusbar.

# Use one of the supported image preview protocols
set preview_images true

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * w3m (default):
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "w3mimgpreview"?
#   This requires the console web browser "w3m" and a supported terminal.
#   It has been successfully tested with "xterm" and "urxvt" without tmux.
#
# * iterm2:
#   Preview images in full color using iTerm2 image previews
#   (http://iterm2.com/images.html). This requires using iTerm2 compiled
#   with image preview support.
#
#   This feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a
#   width of 8 and height of 11 are used.  To use other values, set the options
#   iterm2_font_width and iterm2_font_height to the desired values.
#
# * terminology:
#   Previews images in full color in the terminology terminal emulator.
#   Supports a wide variety of formats, even vector graphics like svg.
#
# * urxvt:
#   Preview images in full color using urxvt image backgrounds. This
#   requires using urxvt compiled with pixbuf support.
#
# * urxvt-full:
#   The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the
#   whole terminal window.
#
# * kitty:
#   Preview images in full color using kitty image protocol.
#   Requires python PIL or pillow library.
#   If ranger does not share the local filesystem with kitty
#   the transfer method is changed to encode the whole image;
#   while slower, this allows remote previews,
#   for example during an ssh session.
#   Tmux is unsupported.
#
# * ueberzug:
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "ueberzug".
#   Images are shown by using a child window.
#   Only for users who run X11 in GNU/Linux.
